# TimeColor Demo — How to Open
Thank you reviewers for taking the time reviewing TimeColor. To see our demo page: 
- **Double-click `index.html`** in this folder (or right-click → *Open with* → your browser).
- Keep the **folder structure unchanged**; all media are loaded via relative paths. No installation or server is required.

**Tips**
- If videos don’t autoplay, click **Play** (audio is muted by default).
- If assets don’t appear, try **Chrome** or **Edge**, and ensure you opened the file directly from disk (no VPN/proxy issues) and didn’t move subfolders.
